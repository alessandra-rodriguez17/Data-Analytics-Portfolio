# Alessandra Rodriguez - Data Analytics Portfolio
## About
Welcome to my portfolio. Here, you will find an expanding collection of my projects as I grow, improve, and learn.
I am a recent graduate of Computer Science from East Texas A&M University with a passion for analytics. I have honed my skills
from constant practice, and I utilize them daily to discover and visualize meaningful insights in data analytics problems.

Throughout my time as East Texas A&M University, I excelled in courses related to Databases, Applied Data Analytics with Python,
Mathematical Statistics with R and AI Data Science & Machine Learning. These classes allowed me to discover my passion in this field.
